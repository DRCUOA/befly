  "scope": "Phase 1: Full-width editor, slide-out metadata panel, minimal default view, non-blocking typography flow. Phase 2: Single accent colour, breathing space.

Phase 5: Single-level nav, global command palette (⌘K). Phase 6: Opinionated defaults, simplified visibility. Phase 7: Write/Edit/Reflect focus modes. Phase 8: Replace alert/confirm with toasts. Phase 9: Last document return, empty state copy (Start a thought). Phase 10: Audit metric prominence. Phase 11: Code-splitting, zero lag typing. Phase 12: Markdown toggle, split preview, version history (future).",
