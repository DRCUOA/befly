  "summary": "Incrementally evolve the befly writing platform toward an attention-protecting, distraction-free UIX where protecting attention is the product.",
  "problem_hl": "Writers need a thinking environment, not a content platform. The current UI exposes all controls at once (metadata, cover, themes, visibility) and uses blocking modals, increasing cognitive load and interrupting flow.",
  "problem_ll": "3",
  "goals": "Radical simplicity in writing surface, visual calm, gentle engagement mechanics, frictionless annotation, calm navigation, reduced decision fatigue, focus modes, micro-interactions under 200ms, emotional design (return to last doc, warm empty states), engagement through depth not noise, performance as UX, optional advanced layer for power users",
  "scope": "Phase 1: Full-width editor, slide-out metadata panel, minimal default view, non-blocking typography flow. Phase 2: Single accent colour, breathing space. Phase 3: Word count on pause, milestone moments (500/1000 words), optional session timer. Phase 4: Inline annotation design, fragment linking hooks. Phase 5: Single-level nav, global command palette (⌘K). Phase 6: Opinionated defaults, simplified visibility. Phase 7: Write/Edit/Reflect focus modes. Phase 8: Replace alert/confirm with toasts. Phase 9: Last document return, empty state copy (Start a thought). Phase 10: Audit metric prominence. Phase 11: Code-splitting, zero lag typing. Phase 12: Markdown toggle, split preview, version history (future).",
  "out_of_scope": "Rich text editor (stay with textarea + Markdown), full annotation/fragment backend (Phase 4 is design + hooks only), dark mode, mobile-specific layouts beyond current responsive",
  "acceptance": "Cognitive load: ≤5 visible controls in Write default view. Time to first keystroke: no regression, <100ms perceived. Typography flow: non-blocking. Empty states: Start a thought. Navigation: single-level, ⌘K reachable. Platform feels still, not busy.",
