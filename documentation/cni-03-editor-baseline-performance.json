  "summary": "Establish performance and safety baseline for long-form editor input",
  "problem_statement": "Before introducing any auto-correction or editor mutation, the current editor’s performance, undo behavior, and data safety characteristics for long-form writing are unknown. Without a baseline, it is impossible to evaluate regressions or determine safe intervention thresholds.",
  "in_scope": [
    "Measure typing latency for small, medium, and large documents",
    "Observe browser undo/redo behavior under programmatic text changes",
    "Identify document size limits and database constraints",
    "Assess risk of data loss due to lack of autosave or draft persistence"

    "Optimizing editor performance",
    "Adding autosave or draft recovery",
    "Implementing auto-correction logic",
    "Changing editor UX or architecture"

  "requirements": [
    "Baseline typing latency measurements are recorded",
    "Undo/redo behavior under mutation is documented",
    "Document size thresholds and risks are identified"
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "A baseline report exists and is linked from the issue",
    "Known performance and safety risks are explicitly listed",
    "No editor behavior has been modified"

  "dependencies": [
    "Ability to run the editor locally",
    "Representative long-form writing samples"

    "Hidden performance degradation at large document sizes",
    "Undo stack corruption when text is mutated",
    "Silent data loss due to missing draft persistence"
  ],
  "implementation_notes": "This is an observational and measurement task only. Do not introduce fixes or mitigations. The goal is to make current limits visible before changing behavior."
