  "summary": "Audit existing editor stack and integration surface",
  "problem_statement": "Editor-level auto-correction must integrate safely within the existing editor, Vue lifecycle, and persistence flows without disrupting cursor position, undo history, or long-form performance. Without a precise audit of the current stack, configuration, and data flow, subsequent implementation risks introducing subtle trust-breaking bugs or architectural misalignment.",
  "in_scope": [
    "Identify current editor technology and versions",
    "Document editor extensions, plugins, and schema",
    "Map text input, key handling, and paste interception points",
    "Document undo/redo and history configuration",
    "Trace autosave and persistence flows end-to-end",
    "Assess performance characteristics for long-form documents"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "Implementing auto-correction logic",
    "Adding or modifying editor extensions",
    "Changing editor UX or behavior",
    "Introducing grammar or spell tooling",
    "Refactoring unrelated frontend or backend code"
  ],
  "requirements": [
    "Editor stack and versions are identified and recorded",
    "All active editor extensions and plugins are enumerated",
    "Safe interception points for future auto-correction are identified"
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "An audit document exists describing the current editor stack and constraints",
    "Known risks and unknowns are explicitly listed",
    "No production code behavior has changed"
  ],
  "dependencies": [
    "Access to frontend repository",
    "Ability to run the editor locally with representative long-form content"
  ],
  "risks": [
    "Hidden editor plugins mutating content unexpectedly",
    "Existing undo history misconfiguration",
    "Performance bottlenecks exposed by long documents"
  ],
  "implementation_notes": "This is an investigative task only. Bias toward documentation over refactoring. Prefer concrete observations and diagrams over speculative fixes."
