  "summary": "Decide editor strategy for long-form writing and future auto-correction",
  "problem_statement": "The platform currently uses a native textarea-based Markdown editor while future plans assume editor-level capabilities such as safe auto-correction and transaction-aware undo. Without an explicit editor strategy decision, subsequent work risks architectural misalignment, wasted effort, and trust-breaking UX regressions for long-form writers.",
  "in_scope": [
    "Evaluate current textarea-based Markdown editor against long-term product goals",
    "Assess feasibility and implications of migrating to TipTap/ProseMirror",
    "Compare UX, performance, accessibility, and complexity trade-offs",
    "Decide and document the chosen editor direction"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "Implementing a new editor",
    "Refactoring existing editor code",
    "Adding auto-correction or grammar logic",
    "Changing persistence or rendering behavior"
  ],
  "requirements": [
    "At least two viable editor strategies are clearly articulated",
    "Trade-offs are evaluated against long-form writer UX goals",
    "A single editor direction is explicitly selected and justified"
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "A written decision document exists and is linked from the issue",
    "The decision is explicit, unambiguous, and future-facing",
    "No production code behavior has changed"
  ],
  "dependencies": [
    "Completed editor stack audit",
    "Clarity on long-term writing and UX goals"
  ],
  "risks": [
    "Deferring the decision leads to mis-scoped implementation work",
    "Choosing an editor that undermines writer trust or flow",
    "Underestimating migration or maintenance costs"
  ],
  "implementation_notes": "This issue is a strategy and positioning decision only. Bias toward clarity and commitment over optionality. The output should constrain future work, not keep options open indefinitely."
